System24 is a Discord theme that mimics the aesthetics of old-school text-based user interfaces (TUIs). It was heavily inspired by the [Spicetify "text" theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/text). The theme features a monospaced font, a darkened color scheme, and sharp corners. Similar to many TUIs, each "panel" is labelled with a title and a border. The theme is completely customizable with CSS variables.

Unexpectedly, system24 ended up becoming my most starred project! Thanks to a r/unixporn reddit post and a viral [tweet](https://x.com/umgbhalla/status/1832474169478672687), it gained over 600 stars in a few days. It was pretty crazy to have my first 1k star project on GitHub.
